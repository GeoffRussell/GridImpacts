### What do all the tools do?

### SelectInput: Datasets

You can select different sets of data corresponding to various time periods. Most are for South Australia, but
there are a couple of Victorian sets and one from the entire NEM.

### Slider: Battery Size in MWh

The is the total energy storage capacity available. In South Australia at the end of 2024, there was 618 MWh of battery storage, most of it in 2 big batteries: 150 MW/194MWh and 250MW/250MWh.

The GridImpacts model assumes that battery storage is **magic**. By which I mean it can store
any excess energy regardless of the power and location of that energy. In the real world, the transmission
lines between that excess energy and the batteries may not be available; they may be being fully used. 
In which case that excess energy will simply be lost; but in my simple model 
with magic batteries, nothing is ever wasted if there is available battery space. 

### Slider: Battery multiplier

For the NEM dataset, you'd want to model much bigger batteries than for South Australia. This slider just
multiplies the battery size. 

### Slider: Gas Peakers (GW) 

Gas turbines in power stations come in a few different types.  Some are expensive and highly efficient, while
others are cheap and less efficient. The AEMO Integrated System Plan for Australia proposed replacing our
current expensive and efficient turbines that operate quite a lot with cheap and less efficient ones that
run less frequently. These cheap turbines are often called *gas peakers*; because it is the cheapest
way of handling unexpected peaks in electricity consumption. You don't want expensive and efficient equipment
standing idle in the off chance that you might need it for a few days a year. 

It's like car makers putting those funny little spare wheels in your boot, rather than a 
full sized spare wheel. They are cheapest way of handling a rare occurrence.

GridImpacts lets you specify some level of gas peakers; in gigawatts. The down side of gas peakers is the
carbon dioxide emissions; in addition to the vast gas infrastructure required to operate any 
gas system.

### Slider: Peaker multiplier 


### Slider: Overbuild factor 

This slider allows you to see what happens if you just double the existing amount of wind and solar capacity. 

As this factor rises, you will see more energy flow into the battery. Eventually the battery will be full and more energy will be curtailed.

### Slider: Baseload size (MW) 

You can test the impact of having a baseload energy source on the amount of overbuild and batteries you
need to eliminate shortfall. Having a baseload source also reduces the need for interconnections and
peaking gas plants.

### Slider: Baseload multiplier 

This is similar to the Battery multiplier.

### Checkbox: Show shortfall (GWh)

You can turn the shortfall display off if you wish to unclutter the chart and focus on some region.

### Checkbox: Show dumped energy (GWh)

Dumping electricity is typically called *curtailment*. When you have low overbuild, this will usually
be because of either grid congestions or economics; meaning you choose to dump energy rather than take 
a low price for your electricity.

### Checkbox: Show wind vs demand 

This click box just strips back the chart to basics and focuses on the wind output and demand. In
South Australia, it is quite common during summer heatwaves for wind output to be at it's lowest when
demand is at its highest. For example select the *"March heatwave, 2024"* dataset and you'll see 
the peaks in demand correspond with drops in wind.

The click box doesn't "play well" with other
selections ... it won't show any Overbuild renewable generation if you have some selected.

### Checkbox: Show battery charge level (%) 

Click this and yet another line appears on the chart showing the battery state over time. 

## Tab: Stats 

The *Stats* tab gives summary statistics for the impacts of changes you make to the sliders.

Have a look at the night of the 24th of November. It was a *very* still night. Assuming you
have dialled in a doubling of wind+solar, the summary board shows
an accumulated shortfall over the night of 5,463, even with twice the renewables that we have now. Can
we fix that shortfall with storage?


## Appendix: Magic batteries and real ones

In the real world every battery has a maximum power rating. It can't deliver power at a level
greater than this, even if it has plenty of energy. Suppose, for example, you have a real 
100 MW/200 MWh battery. All batteries are characterised by two numbers.
They tell you respectively the maximum power rating and the maximum amount of energy that
can be stored. Some people would call it a 100MW/2 hour battery; which means the same thing. 
It can provide a maximum of 100 MW of power for 2 hours; resulting in 
200 MWh of energy being delivered.  If you need 175 MW of power, this battery won't deliver it; you'll need a second battery for the remaining 75 MW. 

Magic batteries don't exist. They are a simplification. Using GridImpacts, you'll be able to
watch as the shortfall reduces as you increase the size of the magic battery. Suppose you dial in 
10,000 MWh of batteries and the shortfall vanishes.  
Does that prove that this storage will be
enough in the real world with a real transmission system and real batteries? No, it does not. 
On the other hand, if 10,000 MWh *didn't* drive the shortfalls to zero, you'd know 
that 10,000 MWh of real batteries wouldn't work; no matter where you put them or how you configured them.  

Note the assymetry. You can prove something won't work with GridImpacts, but not that it will.
