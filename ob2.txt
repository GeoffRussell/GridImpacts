## Generation costs aren't retail costs

Have you ever had to order a cheap item on-line and been annoyed when delivery is far more costly than
the item is worth?  But you can't get it locally and you want it; or perhaps your ankle is in 
plaster and you can't drive and catching the bus to the closest shop is complex.   Electricity is
like that; always. The cost of electricity is dominated by the cost of delivery.
