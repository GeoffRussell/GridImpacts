# What do all the tools do?

## Datasets

You can select different sets of data corresponding to various time periods. Most are for South Australia, but
there are a couple of Victorian sets and one from the entire NEM.

## Battery Size in MWh and magic batteries

The is the total energy storage capacity available. 

The underlying model assumes that of the batteries are **magic**. By which I mean they can store
any excess energy regardless of the power and location of that energy. In the real world, the transmission
capacity between the excess energy and the batteries with spare capacity may be in use. In which case that
excess energy will simply be lost; but in my simple model with magic batteries, nothing is ever wasted if
there is available battery space. 

Similarly, in the real world every battery has a maximum power rating. It can't deliver power at a level
greater than this, even if it has plenty of energy. Suppose, for example, you have a real 
100 MW/200 MWh battery. The two numbers tell you the maximum power rating and the maximum amount of energy that
can be stored. This is a 2-hour battery. It can provide a maximum of 100 MW of power for 2 hours; resulting in 
200 MWh of energy being delivered.  If you need 175 MW of power, this battery won't deliver it; you'll need a second battery for the remaining 75 MW. 

Magic batteries don't exist. They are a simplification. Using the tool, you'll be able to
watch as the shortfall reduces as you increase the size of the magic battery. Suppose you
hit 10 GWh and the shortfall for the period vanishes.  Does that prove that 10 GWh will be
enough in the real world with a real transmission system and real batteries? No, it does not. But
what if 10 GWh *didn't* drive the shortfalls to zero. Then you'd know that 10 GWh of real batteries
wouldn't work; no matter where you put them or how you configured them.  

Note the assymetry. 

## What about intercconnectors?

South Australia currently has 870 MW of interconnectors to Victoria (a large one and a small one). 
They keep the lights on because Victoria, currently, still runs plenty of coal. In the future?  There is a third
interconnector being built (Project Energy Connect). It will deliver another 800 MW of capacity. As long
as Victoria is running coal, these interconnectors will keep the lights on in SA. Losing one interconnector is
considered a *credible* risk by AEMO. Losing both big ones simultaneously would be unlikely; but another Black Summer of bushfires could well make the unlikely distinctly possible. 

Late in 2024, SA Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis revealed plans to add some diesels to SA's reserve capacity. That move shows clearly that the Minister is doing what Minister's should do; put plans in place for the worst
case scenario. 

This grid model is similar. It's looking at dealing with long periods of energy shortfalls which will occur regardless of the amount of overbuild. As eastern Australia removes coal, the value of all interconnectors during still nights will be reduced.
