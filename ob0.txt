#### The starting point: a week of South Australian electricity data

OpenNEM uses data from AEMO, the Australian electricity grid manager, but displays it in 
a friendly, easy to understand format.

Here's an OpenNEM image showing the makeup of a week's worth of electricity in SA during a mild spring
week at the end of November 2023. The current (2025) version of openNEM looks a little different, but the changes
are minimal.

The horizontal axis is date and time with the nights being marked
with a grey vertical band. The vertical axis is power in megawatts. You can see that the wind farms
(green band) produce a considerable portion of the total demand. 

This was a week of mild temperatures; nobody needed heating or cooling. You can see that the
maximum demand was about 1.7 gigawatts (1,700 megawatts). During a heatwave, demand would peak at just over double
this; about 3.5 gigawatts.
