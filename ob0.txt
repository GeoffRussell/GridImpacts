## The starting point: a week of South Australian electricity data

The "Datasets" selection tool lets you examing various sets of data saved over the past several years
using the [openNEM](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=5m&view=discrete-time&group=Detailed) website. OpenNEM uses data from AEMO, the Australian electricity grid manager, but displays it in 
a friendly, easy to understand format.

Now here's an image showing the makeup of a week's worth of electricity in SA during a mild spring
week at the end of November 2023. The current (2025) version of openNEM looks a little different, but the changes
are minimal.

The horizontal axis is time and you can see the nights are marked
by a grey vertical band. The vertical axis is power in megawatts. You can see that the wind farms
(green band) produce a considerable portion of the total demand. 

This was a week of mild temperatures; nobody needed heating or cooling. You can see that the
maximum demand was about 1.7 gigawatts (1,700 megawatts). During a heatwave, demand would peak at just over double
this; about 3.5 gigawatts.
