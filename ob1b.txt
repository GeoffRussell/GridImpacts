## Datasets 

The "Datasets" button lists other sets of data; including the heatwaves in South Australia at the
end of 2019, leading into the *Black Summer* of bush fires. 

Some datasets of interest are:

### June 2024 

The lack of wind during June 2024 was extreme and provides an excellent
example of the difficulties of using batteries to handle such shortfalls.

It's also useful to illustrate how useful baseload power is in reducing
both the overbuild and the battery requirements to handle large wind
droughts.

There are two datasets for this period, one shows just the first week
of June. The dataset covering the whole of June is large and sometimes
the additional detail obscures what is going on.

### January 2024

I've added two datasets for January 2024, the week ending on the 25th. They show the
extraordinarily low wind during the nights of the 23rd and 24th of January. The 8 hours ending at 2am on the 24th
had a wind+solar shortfall of 11,970 MWh; rather more than the 511 MWh we have at present. I subsequently downloaded
data for Victoria; where we got the electricity to keep the lights on during these nights. 

If you select the VIC dataset, you'll see that the night of the 24th was an extraordinarily low wind night, similar
to that in South Australia. In a high penetration wind+solar system, they'd have been hard put to 
be sending us anything. 

### Black Summer Heatwave 

There were multiple heatwaves in Australia during the Black Summer of 2019-20. I've added
a dataset for South Australia, for the second heatwave in December. It illustrates the 
particular problems of still hot days leading into sweltering evenings. Windpower can be
almost totally absent when it is most required.


### What can you demonstrate with this kind of model? 

With a doubling of renewables, the shortfall on the night of 24th of November is considerable; 5,463 MWh. The summary
box shows the maximum power needed during the 8 hours; 340 MW.
Could you cover this particular shortfall with 16 batteries each with a maximum power output of 340MW and lasting
for 1 hour? That will depend on: 

1. exactly where you put them. They have to be fully charged at the start of the period and whether a battery
gets charged depends on where it is relative to any excess electricity which happens to be available. Grids, like
city streets can become congested.  

2. exactly where the power is required. Again, congestion has to be carefully modelled to make claims about what
is possible. 

In summary, the model I've built is more to give people a feel for the problems. A professional model would 
take the physical locations and capabilities into account of every piece of equipment. My little model shows what you **can't** do; you can't solve the problems posed by this still night of the 24th November with anything less than
5,463 MWh of storage, but it doesn't show how much more you will need than this to cover real world complexity.

## What about intercconnectors?

Why don't I model interconnectors? The interconnectors keeping the lights on in South Australia
are both long and fires in Australia are common. During Black Summer (2019-20), [four 330kv transmission lines](https://www.aer.gov.au/system/files/A.2_%202019-20%20%20Bushfire%20Damage%20to%20TransGrid%20Network_%20FINAL_PUBLIC_Redacted.pdf) tripped (stopped transmitting power) within a few minutes of each other and electrically separated NSW and Victoria. So while the extraordinary efforts made by engineers to prevent transmission lines starting fires are largely successful, planning
for failure is always wise.

South Australia currently has 870 MW of interconnectors to Victoria (a large AC one and a 
small DC one). They keep the lights on because Victoria, currently, 
still runs plenty of coal. In the future?  There is a third
interconnector being built (Project Energy Connect). It will deliver another 800 MW of capacity. As long
as Victoria is running coal, these interconnectors will keep the lights on in SA. Losing one interconnector is
considered a *credible* risk by AEMO. Losing both big ones simultaneously would be unlikely; but another Black Summer of bushfires could well make the unlikely possible. 

Late in 2024, SA Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis revealed plans to add some diesels to SA's reserve capacity. That move shows clearly that the Minister is doing what Minister's should do; 
plan for the worst. Koutsantonis is looking at dealing with long periods of energy shortfalls which will occur regardless of the amount of overbuild. As eastern Australia removes coal, the value of all interconnectors during still nights will be reduced. 

GridImpacts allows you to see how hard it is to plan for the worst without
baseload power. You need extraordinary amounts of both storage and generations; and you
can throw away large amounts of what you generate.

## Concluding remarks

A large electricity grid is an astonishing creation requiring a
considerable set of skills from a large set of teams. Australia has
stumbled into its decision to try and build a 100% renewable system as a
direct consequence of not looking seriously at the alternative; namely,
leaving the grid substantially alone and just swap out the thermal coal
plants of thermal nuclear plants.

The decision to not consider nuclear seriously is partly the fault of the
nuclear industry itself. It never really came to grips with the improved
understanding of cancer that was emerging in the 1980s and is still
developing. How bizarre is it that you can walk into supermarkets and
bottleshops anywhere in Australia and buy potent carcinogenic foodstuffs,
but we ban nuclear power?

Anybody over 50 in Australia can get a [free bowel cancer screening
kit](https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/national-bowel-cancer-screening-program).
You get a little booklet which tells you:

> *"People who smoke, are overweight, have a diet low in fresh vegetables and fruit, and high in red and processed meats, are at increased risk of **several cancers**" [emphasis added]

That's about as good an example as you get of bolting the stable door
a couple of decades after the horses have left.

We have a myriad of organisations in Australia whose hands and lips are
arc-welded to both traditional anti-nuclear policies and traditional
cancer causing foods; giving us a position near the top of the per person
global cancer tables.

The idea that a plane could fly into a nuclear plant and unleash a
disaster is a given for these groups and, I suspect, for the industry
itself.

But could any such accident rival the cancer impacts of alcohol,
red and processed meat and tobacco? Impossible. The death toll from
flying a plane into an office block would be considerably higher, so
why don't we demand they be safe in the face of such attacks? Because
that would stop the office block building in its tracks. The biggest
impact of a successful attack on a nuclear plant has always been the
direct impacts on the staff and the withdrawal of the service; the
electricity.  Nevertheless the nuclear regulatory ratchet, tightened by
fierce campaigning based on information now known to be false, remains
just as tight as it has ever been. Leading to an industry bogged down
by regulators and its own failure to push-back and unroll the barriers.
