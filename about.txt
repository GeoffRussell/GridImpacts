LABEL(about)

The source code for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeoffRussell/GridImpacts). It
is written in Shiny R.

Most of the datasets are South Australian (SA) data.  This is partly
because I live in SA, but also because SA has more renewables per capita
than any other state and so is better placed to illustrate the choices
that will need to be made as renewable penetration increases.

Data on this site comes either from OpenNEM, typically by downloading data from a [view](https://explore.openelectricity.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=5m&view=discrete-time&group=Detailed).

## Technical details about the OpenNEM data

1. openNEM exports different fields for different regions, **Demand** is taken to be the sum of all
fields before the "Temperature" field, except for 
the *"date"*, *"Battery (Charging) - (MW)"* and  *"Exports - MW"* fields. 

2. Renewable generation is assumed to be what is sometimes called "Variable Renewable Energy" (VRE), 
meaning the two solar fields + the wind field + the amount exported. 
ie., the negative of the "Exports - MW". Note that the export field has a negative sign. 
This assumption implies that all of the exported electricity is from the renewable sources. This
is probably true in SA, but not elsewhere, but it a fairly *renewable-generous* assumption.
