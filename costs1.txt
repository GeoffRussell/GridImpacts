## Nuclear lifetime costs

The US Department of Energy recently released a report on the US nuclear industry in the context of
the joint statement by over 30 countries to triple the global nuclear power capacity. Among other things it
considered the impacts of including nuclear power in a predominantly renewable grid.


It found that nuclear reduces the costs of such a grid. Here's an image which shows what they expect.

How does nuclear reduce costs? 

By reducing intermittency and  the total amount of stuff you need to build. Again, here's
a figure showing the situation with reference to the US grid. The US grid currently gets about 20% of
electricity with nuclear and costs will go down if they can double this.

The report also gave estimates of the total cost of electricity from a nuclear plant over an 80 year lifespan.

I have used the findings of this image to estimate a rough multiplier of about 3 to get the total cost
of a nuclear plant over a 60 year lifespan relative to the capital cost. The estimate is simple,  just
multiply the estimate of $50-$150/MWh by the total number of MWh produced by US reactors (which typically
have a 90% capacity factor and add in the $30/MWh over the remaining period. 

Play around with GridImpacts and you'll soon find that the DOE results are really pretty obvious. The details
and exact numbers are complex, but the nature of the outcome is clear.
