## Caveats 

A real financial model would guess the price of everything and devise a purchasing timeline and use the
price at the time to model every purchase. If wind, solar and batteries continue to decline in price, this
will give a lower price compared to my simply pick a price and buy everything approach. You could pick a suitably
low price and get the same answer. I'm loath to use the more accurate method because it complicates the process 
without making much difference.  

The big question is simple. Does whacking 10-15 GW of nuclear (probably the most we could build before 2050) make
the generation of electricity cheaper or more expensive. It will certainly require coal/gas plants for longer before leading to a cleaner system in the long run.  I don't see anybody in the Australian political landscape who
actually  gives a damn about the climate. There are just varying level of pretence and virtue signaling. If you
want to offset that delay in closing coal, then you just drop the cattle population by a suitable amount. Back
in 1990 the sheep population went from 190 million to about 70 million in less than a decade. Did you
notice? Unless you were a sheep farmer, the answer is probably "No!". If you care about the climate, then
you will regard cattle similarly to coal; they generate more warming annually than our domestically burned fossil 
fuels.

So will the inaccuracies of my cost model make a difference to answering the big question? I think not; given the
US DOE has looked at the same question and got qualitatively the same answer. Adding nuclear power to a largely
renewable system makes it cheaper. The system has to be "largely renewable" for now, because we will take some
time to developne nuclear building expertise. Eventually, a rational person would opt for all nuclear. It's
far better environmentally than renewables. Less mining, less habitat destruction, less pollution, easier waste
management. It's simply better.

Okay, let's proceed with a few other notes and then discuss nuclear costs and the recent US DOE report.

## Reminder ... costs ain't costs 


It pays to recall that when 
Chris Bowen says, correctly, that renewables are the cheapest way to generate electricity, he
isn't talking about costs. Generation costs are a small part of retail costs. Other parts are

1. Transmission ... the big towers and cables that transmit electricity long distances
1. Distribution ... the small poles and wires that transmit electricity the last few kms to your home or business 
1. Reliability ... how much does it cost to generate solar power at night? You can't. You need storage of some kind and that pushes prices up. 

GridImpacts doesn't consider transmission or distribution, but it does tackle reliability. Play with the various settings and you'll soon understand why the cheapest form of generation is not usually the cheapest when reliability is considered.

Of the three big components of electricity costs, *distribution* is the biggest. Suppose you had
a free way of generating electricity, if that technology meant you had to rebuild the distribution system in any
substantial manner, then the retail price would rise. The distribution system isn't just wondrous complex, it is
an accumulated asset built over decades. 

Here's a chart which highlights the difference between generation costs and retail costs. It's misleading because it
includes recent subsidies. Without these the retail line would be even higher. Note also how the retail price
was largely insulated from the huge spike in costs when Russia invaded Ukraine.

## Nuclear: Lifetime costs

The US Department of Energy recently released a report on the US nuclear industry in the context of
the joint statement by over 30 countries to triple the global nuclear power capacity by 2050. Among other things it
considered the impacts of including nuclear power in a predominantly renewable grid.


It found that nuclear reduces the costs of such a grid. Here's an image which shows what they expect.

How does nuclear reduce costs? 

It's pretty obvious when you think about it.  The problems for wind and solar are still nights, and runs of still 
nights. Solving those requires a vast mining effort for critical minerals for batteries and thousands of kilometres
of extra transmission to move energy from where you harvest it to where you need it. 

Here's a plot of South Australian demand and wind power during the first week of June 2024. 

![](wind-sa-june-1st-week.png){style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"}

You can see the problem. When the wind is blowing SA has more than enough wind power to meet all the state's demand, but during this week we'd have gone dark without gas and Victorian coal. 

Stick a gigawatt of baseload into the SA grid (as two 500MW reactors) and your problems are greatly reduced. 

![](wind-sa-june-1st-week-mod.png){style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"}

So it's now blindingly obvious that you will now need far less stuff (batteries/transmission/pumped hydro) to keep you
grid supplied.

But what isn't obvious is whether the price you pay for that baseload is cheaper than the savings you make
by needing less stuff. You need a bit more analysis to work that out; but not much. GridImpacts can
determine which is cheaper, even if it isn't doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a professional modelling
tool. I have deliberately chosen to keep GridImpacts simple and to make every assumption transparently obvious. 


The US DOE report gives a figure showing the financial situation with reference to the US grid. 
The US grid currently gets about 20% of
electricity with nuclear and costs will go down if they can double this.

![](liftoff-fig7-firmingwithnuclear.png){style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"}

The report also gave estimates of the total cost of electricity from a nuclear plant over an 80 year lifespan.

![](liftoff-fig31-lifespan.png){style="width: 100%; margin: auto;"}

I have used the data from this image to estimate a rough multiplier of about 3 to get the total cost
of a nuclear plant over a 60 year lifespan relative to the capital cost. Deriving this estimate is simple,  just
multiply the estimate of $50-$150/MWh by the total number of MWh produced by US reactors (which typically
have a 90% capacity factor and add in the $30/MWh over the remaining period. 

Play around with GridImpacts and you'll soon find that the DOE results are qualitatively obvious. The details
of exactly how much money nuclear saves are complex, but that it will save money isn't.
