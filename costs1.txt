## Nuclear: Lifetime costs

The US Department of Energy recently released a report on the US nuclear industry in the context of
the joint statement by over 30 countries to triple the global nuclear power capacity by 2050. Among other things it
considered the impacts of including nuclear power in a predominantly renewable grid.


It found that nuclear reduces the costs of such a grid. Here's an image which shows what they expect.

How does nuclear reduce costs? 

It's pretty obvious when you think about it.  The problems for wind and solar are still nights, and runs of still 
nights. Solving those requires a vast mining effort for critical minerals for batteries and thousands of kilometres
of extra transmission to move energy from where you harvest it to where you need it. 

Here's a plot of South Australian demand and wind power during the first week of June 2024.

You can see the problem. When the wind is blowing SA has more than enough wind power to meet all the state's demand, but during this week we'd have gone dark without gas and Victorian coal. 

Stick a gigawatt of baseload into the SA grid (as two 500MW reactors) and your problems are greatly reduced.

So it's now blindingly obvious that you will now need far less stuff (batteries/transmission/pumped hydro) to keep you
grid supplied.

But what isn't obvious is whether the price you pay for that baseload is cheaper than the savings you make
by needing less stuff. You need a bit more analysis to work that out; but not much. GridImpacts can
determine which is cheaper, even if it isn't doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a professional modelling
tool. I have deliberately chosen to keep GridImpacts simple and to make every assumption transparently obvious. 


The US DOE report gives a figure showing the financial situation with reference to the US grid. 
The US grid currently gets about 20% of
electricity with nuclear and costs will go down if they can double this.

The report also gave estimates of the total cost of electricity from a nuclear plant over an 80 year lifespan.

I have used the data from this image to estimate a rough multiplier of about 3 to get the total cost
of a nuclear plant over a 60 year lifespan relative to the capital cost. Deriving this estimate is simple,  just
multiply the estimate of $50-$150/MWh by the total number of MWh produced by US reactors (which typically
have a 90% capacity factor and add in the $30/MWh over the remaining period. 

Play around with GridImpacts and you'll soon find that the DOE results are qualitatively obvious. The details
of exactly how much money nuclear saves are complex, but that it will save money isn't.
