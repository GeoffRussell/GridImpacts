#### Understanding the graph

This graph was produced using the [OpenNEM website](https://opennem.org.au/energy/sa1/?range=7d&interval=5m&view=discrete-time) on the 29th of November 2023. 
OpenNEM uses data from AEMO, the Australian electricity grid manager, but displays it in 
a friendly, easy to understand format.

Did I select that date because of some special attributes in
the data? I did notice the small choke point on the evening of the 24th of November, but hadn't quantified
it. I'd had the idea for this project for some time and just happened to make a start on that evening and so used
that week's data. 

If you visit the OpenNEM site now, you'll see a different image, because the make up of the South Australian
electricity supply is heavily dependent on the weather. 

The OpenNem website graph is interactive, allowing you to explore features of the data in considerable detail. But the features software designers choose to measure and highlight never cover everything. 

Look at the vertical axis, you can see 1,500 at the top left. That's
1,500 million watts, usually called mega-watts and abbreviated MW. As
I mentioned, this is less than half of peak demand during a heat wave.

The colours represent the different sources of electricity as explained in the legend below the graph; green is wind power. 

#### Explainer: Power and energy

Skip this section if you understand the difference between power and energy. 

It's not really that complicated. Your electric jug
will have a power rating on it somewhere which will give, obviously,
it's power. Mine is 2,000 watts; which is pretty common. When I was 
growing up, jugs were smaller and typically were about 1,000 watts. Boil
an amount of water in 1,000 and 2,000 watt jugs and the
second will boil it twice as fast.

That's what more power does. Double the power used and the work takes half as long.

But both jugs will use exactly the
same amount of energy to do boil the same amount of water from a starting temperature. 
Run a 2,000 watt jug for 1 hour
and it will use 2,000 watt-hours of electricity. The term watt-hour
is a unit of energy. What could be simpler? Run a power source for
a given length of time and the energy used is just the power
multiplied by the time. Writing it with a hyphen between them makes it
ever so obvious what is happening.  100 kilowatt-hours of electricity
is the quantity of energy used by running:

1. One hundred 1,000 watt jugs for an hour or
1. one huge 100,000 watt urn for an hour or
1. one 1,000 watt jug for 100 hours.

I'm assuming, of course, that most people get that
"kilo" means a thousand; as in kilometre, 1,000 metres. 

1. A *megawatt* (MW) is a thousand kilowatts, meaning a million watts, 
1. A *gigawatt* (GW) is a thousand megawatts, a billion; 1,000,000,000.
1. A *terawatt* (TW) is a thousand gigawatts, a trillion; 1 with 12 zeros after it.

### Shortfall

Australian grids operate in 5 minute planning intervals. Every 5 minutes decisions are made about which 
generators or collectors will provide electricity for the next 5 minute slot. Suppliers bid to be selected. 

Wind and solar farms don't need to bid a high enough amount to make money. They will receive *renewable 
energy credits* for every MWh they supply, they can sell these to people wanting to offset carbon dioxide
emissions. The market price for these is [typically over $40](https://www.cleanenergyregulator.gov.au/Infohub/Markets/Pages/qcmr/march-quarter-2022/Large-scale-generation-certificates-(LGCs).aspx).

For any time slot, I'll assume that if there is wind power available, it will have been selected. Similarly
for solar power. If you look at the image, you'll see that some of the time the colours drop 
below the 0 MW line. These negative values mean power is being exported out across the interconnectors. 

During the previous 12 months, SA was a net electricity importer; we imported 1,605 gigawatt-hours 
and exported about half that, 821 gigawatt hours. 

If you add up the difference between what renewables provided during each 5-minute slot and the demand
during that slot, then you get an *accumulating shortfall*. This assumes, as I said above, that all wind and solar
available gets used. For the week above, the accumulated shortfall at the end of the week is 40 GWh. Multiply that
by 52 and you'd get the total shortfall for the year, if all weeks were the same; which they aren't.  But if this
arbitrary week is representative then we'd expect to need about 2,000 GWh to cover the gap. The total amount 
of Gas fired electricty over the previous 12 months was 3,138 GWh; meaning my arbitrary week was a good week for renewables; normally the shortfall was larger bigger. That 3,138 number comes from an OpenNEM chart. It is
the equivalent of a single 360 MW gas plant running 24x7; a considerable reduction from 2016 when we had 760MW of coal. 

The total output of our wind and solar plants over the past 12 months has been 10,141 GWh (OpenNEM again); that's
about as much as a single full sized nuclear plant.  

#### Getting a feel for the dynamics 

The "Dashboard Statistics" tab of this website is a (very) simplified model of an electricity grid. 

It's simple enough 
that anybody can play with it without an engineering degree. But complex enough to help
train our intuition about power, energy, battery capacities and the like. 

You can pick from various sets of real world data.

The default dataset shows the *renewable electricity supply* and the *total demand* from a week in November 2023.

It's obvious that without gas and the interconnectors, SA would have been in darkness for many nights.


This is clear from the graph where there are regions where the supply curve is below the demand curve. 
It's one thing to say that SA gets 72 percent of its electricity
from wind and solar **on average**, without understanding the size of the occasional gaps between
demand and supply.

Here's some exercises you can do with the model. 

1. Don't do anything, just look at the Demand and Wind+Solar curves. They look very different from the chart on
the "Help" tab page, but they aren't, they've just been isolated from the interconnector and gas inputs. 
Notice that the *Overbuild* factor starts at 1 ... so you won't see anything for that at all.


2. What is *Overbuild*? Use your mouse to move the "Overbuild" slider to something big like 2. That will double the
amount of generated wind+solar electricity; but keep the proportions the same.
In the real world, the output of such a doubling wouldn't simply
be double the current output, but it wouldn't be wildly different.  If you moved the Overbuild slider
you will have seen a cyan curve appear on the graph. 

3. *Baseload*. You can specify a level of baseload power and see the difference it makes to the requirement
for batteries and overbuild. Australia's current electricity market is quite bizarre and only makes sense to
people who've spent a lifetime in the industry. If you specify, for example, 600MW of baseload, then it
will always be running with renewables handling peaks either directly or via any specified battery storage.

### Summary statistics 

There is a summary statistics tab which analyses the impacts of changes you make to the sliders.

If you are looking at the *default* dataset, take a look at the night
of the 24th of November. It was a *very* still night. Set the Overbuild factor
to 2, the summary statistics now shows an
accumulated shortfall over the night of 4,485 MWh, even with twice the
renewables that we have now. Can we fix that shortfall with storage?

### Fixing shortfalls with storage 

Now let's look at how storage can smooth the intermittency of wind and solar; still assuming the default
dataset of "WE 30 November 2023".

1. Click on the "Show battery charge level" tick box. The default battery size is roughly what we have
in 2024, 500MWh. The battery in the model isn't a real one, it has no power limit, just an energy storage capacity. If you've followed the instructions this far, you'll see 4 times during the week when the battery 
is drained. It always begins the week full!

   Now set the "Battery size" to 2,000 MWh. It's a little tricky to pick this out. If you do, 
there are just two times during the week when it is drained. Currently, December 2024, SA has 524 MW of 
battery power and 618MWh of storage; meaning that using 524 MW for a bit over an hour will drain 
almost everything. 
   
   Since, at this stage we have no interconnectors in the model, a drained battery during a period of where wind+solar is less than the demand means a blackout. It's that simple; even when we assume double the level of wind+solar that supplies 72 percent on average. Think about that. 

   > We have 72% from wind+solar, double that amount, and we'd still be blacked out during a significant part of that week in 2023; without Victorian coal.
   
2. Now click on the "Show dumped energy" tick box. You'll see about 188 GWh of electricity is dumped. Meaning we generated it, but even with 2,000 MWh of battery capacity we had to dump it.
