# AEMO ISP

Australia's energy market operator, AEMO, has an Integrated System Plan (ISP) for Australia, designed 
to meet the carbon emissions goal of the current Government (the ALP as of January 2025).

## Storage

The ISP [generation and storage outlook](https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/major-publications/integrated-system-plan-isp/2024-integrated-system-plan-isp) contains multiple scenarios and multiple *candidate development pathways* (CDPs) 
within those scenarios. I've chosen to present the model represented by CDP3; the *least cost* CDP. 

### Two big questions?

1. How much storage does the ISP require?
2. Who will pay for it? 
3. Who will control it? 

First let's look at the storage as shown in the ISP.  I've merged various classes of storage based on ownership. I've
grouped the various kinds of large scale utility storage into one category and the various categories of household
storage into another. The cost of the ISP doesn't include the costs incurred by householders in buying storage, despite
the fact that most of the storage is *assumed* to be "coordinated", meaning controlled by AEMO or some other
more locallised mechanism (e.g., virtual power plants (VPP). 

If householder's don't buy the storage, then the ISP will need to change radically; the storage is central.
