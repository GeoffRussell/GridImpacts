# AEMO ISP

Australia's energy market operator, AEMO, has an Integrated System Plan (ISP) for Australia, designed 
to meet the carbon emissions goal of the current Government (the ALP as of January 2025).

The ISP [generation and storage outlook](https://aemo.com.au/energy-systems/major-publications/integrated-system-plan-isp/2024-integrated-system-plan-isp) contains multiple scenarios and multiple *candidate development pathways* (CDPs) 
within those scenarios. I've chosen to present the model represented by CDP3; the *least cost* CDP.
